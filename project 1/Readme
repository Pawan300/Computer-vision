This project is basically provide two functions :
- Invisibilty of a human face from the webcam frames.
- Social distancing tracking of humans using webcam.

This projet using the algorithm implemnted by https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/23/simple-object-tracking-with-opencv/
for face recognition.

You can run invisible using :
python3 object_tracker.py -p object_detection/deploy.prototxt -m object_detection/model.caffemodel

And social distancing one using :
python3 social_distancing.py -p object_detection/deploy.prototxt -m object_detection/model.caffemodel
